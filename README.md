Project Name: ClaimVision – Predictive Insurance Insights

Description:
ClaimVision is a data-driven solution designed to help AutoInland, a West African auto insurance provider, predict which customers are likely to submit a vehicle insurance claim within the next three months. This predictive model enables the company to improve financial planning, optimize resource allocation, and deliver proactive customer service.

The project involved collecting and preprocessing historical policy and claim data, including features such as customer demographics, vehicle specifications, policy types, claim history, and behavioral indicators. After exploratory data analysis and feature engineering, several classification algorithms were evaluated, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. The final model was selected based on performance, explainability, and deployment readiness.

Model Type:

Supervised Machine Learning – Classification Model

Evaluation Metric:

The F1 Score was used as the primary evaluation metric to balance precision and recall, given the potential imbalance between claim and non-claim classes. This ensured the model effectively captured both false positives (over-alerting) and false negatives (missed high-risk customers).

Technologies Used:

Python – for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation

Pandas & NumPy – for data manipulation

Scikit-learn & XGBoost – for building and tuning classification models

Matplotlib & Seaborn – for data visualization and exploratory analysis

Jupyter Notebooks – for prototyping and analysis

Streamlit – for deploying a simple user interface

Power BI – for delivering visual insights to stakeholders

Target Market:

Claims Management Team: To forecast and manage claim volumes in advance, ensuring optimal resource planning.

Customer Service Department: To provide tailored engagement and preventive communication to high-risk customers.

Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A) Team: To incorporate predicted claims into financial forecasting and strategic planning.

Risk & Underwriting Team (future scope): To support dynamic premium pricing and better risk segmentation.

Business Impact:

Improved operational readiness and faster claims processing

Enhanced customer satisfaction through anticipatory support

Better alignment of budgets and staffing with forecasted claim trends

Scalable foundation for future AI use cases in insurance
